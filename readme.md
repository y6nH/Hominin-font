# Hominin font

This is my first, incomplete attempt at making a font, as part of the *Type Design 101* course from the League of Movable Type. It's a basic sans-serif. It has all 26 lowercase letters, a few of the capitals and punctuation marks, and no numbers yet.

Hominin is made using FontForge, the open-source font editor.
